Challenge overview

In fault-tolerant quantum computing, non-Clifford gates are very expensive.
Real quantum algorithms are built from large amounts of reversible arithmetic and T-heavy subroutines. Your goal in this challenge is to to minimize
fault-tolerant cost by compiling few-qubit quantum circuits into a sequences of
Clifford+T gates, i.e., the gates generated by {H, T, CN OT } operations. Your
circuits must only contain {H, T, T † , CN OT } gates. You can find the specifics
on these circuits in the next section. Each subsequent compilation task is meant
to be a little more involved than a previous ones. Also, many consequential pairs
of circuits are related, so try to really understand the structure of your solutions.
The topic of Clifford+T compilation is rich and mature, so there are a lot
of useful references you can find online that will help you with the challenge.
You might find the following paper and corresponding software handy: Refs. [1,
2]. You are also welcome to use Superquantum’s very own rmsynth compiler [3]
which is based on the research by Amy & Mosca [4, 5]. Note, however, that you
are not required to use any particular software, but we ask you to submit your
quantum circuits as qasm files. More on that in Section 3.

Unitaries to compile & scoring

As mentioned you will be asked to compile unitaries into Clifford+T sequences.
There are ten 2-qubit ones and a single 4-qubit one:

This is just a sanity check to make sure you understand the task and that
the submission works properly.

Here, you will really need to apply your compilers!
3. Exponential of a Pauli string: exp(i π7 Z ⊗ Z).
This is a crucial ingredient in quantum simulation algorithms.
4. Exponential of a Hamiltonian H1 = XX + Y Y : exp(i π7 H1 ).
Think about the structure of the summands in H1 .
5. Exponential of a Hamiltonian H2 = XX + Y Y + ZZ: exp(i π2 H2 ).
Think about the structure of the terms as well as the matrix form. Does it
resemble anything? The compiled circuit is easier than you might think.
6. Exponential of a Hamiltonian: H3 = XX + ZI + IZ: exp(i π7 H3 ).
This is a time evolution under a 2-qubit transverse field Ising model.
7. State preparation. Design U ∈ C4×4 that maps
|00⟩ 7→ (0.1061479384 − 0.679641467i)|00⟩
+(−0.3622775887 − 0.453613136i)|01⟩

+(0.3276449279 − 0.1101628411i)|11⟩.
Preparation of arbitrary quantum states is an important and a notoriously
hard task in quantum computing. Note that there are many unitaries that
can perform this mapping. We ask you to submit the one for which you
obtain the best metrics.
In case relevant, this state is generated via
qiskit.quantum_info.random_statevector(4, seed=42).

it using some of the previous results.

Same as above – figure out the structure of this gate and it will be easy

Random quantum circuits are widely used in "quantum supremacy" experiments [6] and are even believed to have connections to black hole physics
[7].
In case relevant, this matrix is generated via
qiskit.quantum_info.random_unitary(4, seed=42).
11. 4-qubit diagonal unitary. Consider U acting on 4 qubits such that U |x⟩ =
eiφ(x) |x⟩ and x ∈ {0, 1}4 . The phase φ(x) is the following:
φ(0000) = 0,

Submission and scoring

Throughout the duration of the challenge, the compilation results should be
submitted through iquhack.superquantum.io. Upon opening the website, you
will be prompted to enter your team’s API key which will be provided to you
shortly after the start of the hackathon. After entering the key, you will be able
to see the submissions from all the teams and the corresponding submission
metrics. You will also be able to make your own submission for any of the
challenges. The submissions should be made as plaintext OpenQASM circuit
specifications, with both OpenQASM 2 and OpenQASM 3 being supported.
After each successful submission, your team will be issued a 3 minute cooldown
before you can make another submission for any of the challenges. Even after
making a submission, please keep the corresponding OpenQASM file locally in
case of any technical issues down the line.
There is no single scoring function used to determine the best submission for
a challenge. Instead, the judges will take all of the present submission metrics
into account to evaluate each team. The final team placement will also depend
heavily on the final write-up and presentation detailing the specific compilation

approaches used and any supporting information that must be present in the
team’s final GitHub submission repository.
The two metrics that that you will be able to see for all teams for all challenges throughout the hacking period are
1. Operator norm distance:
d(U, Ũ ) = min ∥U − Ũ ∥op ,
ϕ∈[0,2π)

where U is the exact unitary we want you to approximate and Ũ is your
Clifford+T sequence. We take care of global phase calculation.
2. T -count. This is simply an integer representing the number of T and T †
gates in your submission.
Note that your circuits must only contain {H, T, T † , CN OT } gates. Our grader
will not accept the circuit otherwise. To convert some standard gates into H
and T , please consult the next section.

Useful identities

Here are some formulas you might find useful:
• As you all remember from the workshop, Clifford gates preserve the Pauli
group. Here are few examples of this:
HXH = Z,
HZH = X,
SXS † = Y,
SY S † = −X.
• Let Hermitian M satisfy M 2 = I. Then,
eiθM = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)M
• Key to a lot of quantum simulation problems is the Trotter product formula:
eA+B = lim (eA/k eB/k )k
k→∞

for arbitrary complex square matrices A and B.
